                Hello and welcome to My Portfolio! I'm Matthew, a student at the Nova Scotia Community College (NSCC)
                in Halifax, Nova Scotia. My academic journey has been a dynamic blend of collaborative learning and
                hands-on experiences, epitomized by a Capstone project that delved into project management and Agile
                development practices. Proficient in a diverse range of programming languages, I hold certifications in
                TensorFlow and Qiskit, reflecting my commitment to AI and Quantum Computing. Beyond the digital
                landscape, I've ventured into personal projects, including creating a home NAS on Unraid that hosts my
                Nextcloud server. Join me in exploring this portfolio, a testament to curiosity, and passion for the
                endless possibilities within the world of technology.
